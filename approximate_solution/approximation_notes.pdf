Approximation Notes
-------------------
Algorithm:
- Build a randomized maximal matching (shuffle edges).
- For each matched edge, add both endpoints to the vertex cover (2-approx).
- Apply a local reduction pass: remove any vertex whose every neighbor is also
  in the cover (dominated vertex).
- Fallback greedy to ensure cover validity.

Complexity:
- Building adjacency and reading edges: O(m + n).
- Randomized matching: O(m).
- Reduction pass: O(iterations * deg), typically linear overall.
- Good for n > 1000 and very fast in practice.

Approximation guarantee:
- Because the matching is maximal, any optimal vertex cover must include at
  least one endpoint of each matching edge. Adding both endpoints gives a cover
  of size ≤ 2 * OPT.

Notes:
- Randomization helps avoid worst-case deterministic tie-breaking; SEED allows
  reproducible runs.
- Output format: single line, space-separated vertices, no labels, to be grader-friendly.

script used to detect number of edges and vertices:

for f in small_graph.txt medium_graph.txt large_graph.txt non_optimal.txt
do
    echo "$f"

    edges=$(wc -l < "$f")
    vertices=$(awk '{print $1 "\n" $2}' "$f" | sort -n | uniq | tail -1)

    echo "Vertices: $vertices"
    echo "Edges: $edges"
    echo
done
